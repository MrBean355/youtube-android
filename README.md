üî¥ I occasionally stream on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/mr_bean355)!

Demo projects are split into separate folders within this repository, check them out!

If you want to open the code in Android Studio, you'll need to open the root folder.
Note that you will need to build with JDK 11, which comes bundled with Android Studio.
